A React app that tells you what are the dominant colors in a given picture.

1. Important Info:
  - If you want to fork this project, and work on it in your local environment, you have to get your own API key at https://www.clarifai.com/ (it's free). All you need to do is sign up and create a new API key. 
  - Once you have your API key, go to ".env_sample" and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your API key. Rename the file to just ".env" and that's it. 
  - On your terminal, run npm install.
  - Then run npm start.
  - Enjoy.
